## Next steps 
#### 1. We would like to make the page look better through Bootstrap and/or CSS 
#### 2. We would like to add an additional feature where students can comment on other student's diary entries for suggestions, support, etc..
#### 3. We want to restructure code so that we can make the application look like our wireframe.
